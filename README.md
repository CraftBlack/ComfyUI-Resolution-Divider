# ComfyUI-Resolution-Divider

A smart utility node for **ComfyUI** designed to calculate downscaled resolutions while strictly maintaining the original aspect ratio.

This node is essential for **Image-to-Video (I2V)** workflows (like **Wan 2.2**), where using high-resolution input images often leads to **OOM (Out of Memory)** errors. It helps you find the "sweet spot" (e.g., 480p or 720p) instantly without manual calculations.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Smart Parsing:** Accepts various format inputs like `1920x1080`, `1920 1080`, or `1920, 1080`.
*   **Auto-Detect Resolution:** Select an image from your input folder or **upload one directly** on the node. It automatically reads the dimensions.
*   **Real-Time Calculation:** The "Live Result" updates instantly via JavaScript as you adjust the slider—no need to queue the prompt to see the numbers.
*   **VRAM Saver:** Perfect for downscaling 4K/HD images to manageable sizes for heavy models (Wan 2.2, Kling, etc.) without making the image "squashed" or "stretched".
*   **Clean UI:** Optimized widget layout for a smooth user experience.

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Manual Clone
1. Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CraftBlack/ComfyUI-Resolution-Divider.git
   ```
4. Restart ComfyUI.

### Method 2: ComfyUI Manager

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Add the Node:**
   *   Right-click canvas -> `Add Node` -> `Resolution Utils` -> `Resolution Divider (VRAM Saver)`.
2. **Input:**
   *   **Option A:** Type the resolution manually in `res_string` (e.g., `1024x1024`).
   *   **Option B:** Click "Upload" or select an image from the dropdown. The node will auto-fill the resolution.
3. **Set Divider:**
   *   Adjust the `divider` float value.
   *   `1.0` = Original Size.
   *   `1.5` = 1.5x smaller (Great for Wan 2.2).
   *   `2.0` = Half size.
4. **Connect:**
   *   The node outputs a custom `RESULT` string (for display) and a standard `STRING` (for info).
   *   *Note:* This node is primarily a calculator. You manually use the numbers shown in "Live Result" to set your Latent size, or you can expand this node to output INT width/height in the future.

## 💡 Why "Divider"?

Unlike "Scale" nodes which usually multiply (upscale), this node **divides** (downscales).

$$ \text{New Size} = \frac{\text{Original Size}}{\text{Divider}} $$

Example:
*   Input: `1280 x 720`
*   Divider: `1.5`
*   Result: `853 x 480` (Perfect 480p safe zone for heavy AI models)
